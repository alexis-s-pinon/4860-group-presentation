                requirements, and understanding the software and hardware of computers.</li>
            <li>Majored in CIS, but it started in computer science. He enjoyed the utilities and security aspects of
                CIS and wasn’t too interested in the development side of technology.</li>

                    protocols and are compliant.</li>
                <li>Workflow: stakeholders present a product/service/task, requirements/issue analysis,

                management.</li>
            <li>We as students should participate in organizations that grow our expertise in this field, whether in
                small or professional events.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>“Everything is a project.”</li>
            <li>“95 to 99 percent of projects aren’t completed on time or don’t even start.”</li>
